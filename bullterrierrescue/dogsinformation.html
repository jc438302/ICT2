   <h2>Name: Kobe</h2>
   <p>I don’t really like to talk about me, but they tell me that I have to introduce myself, so I'll give it a go. You see, This is 
new to me I'm a little bit unsure of what to say, but here goes.
My Name is Kobe, I was born on the 1st October 2016 My world revolves around the attention and cuddles of my 
people.
I've been around other large female dogs and they are alright I guess, but they're not allowed anywhere near my food 
or my people if it's my turn in the limelight – A submissive girl might be OK, but we would need our own space at 
feeding time. I'm am an inside dog, apart from at feed time when I have some time in the yard. I like to sleep by my 
people, just in case the bogeyman or one of those scary storms might jump out and get me. I'm OK as long as you're 
there to snuggle and reassure me.
I can do kids, but ones that are a bit older and understand my boundaries will be best. Cats are OK we would need to 
be introduced with care.I've been well behaved lately, but do have a history of chewing up my toys and bedding just 
for fun.
Fences should be a minimum of 5ft, secure and not able to be dug under. My current exercise regime consists of a 
daily jaunt of the neighbourhood. I get all excited on lead to start with, but will settle once we get into it. If I could 
describe my perfect new family, it would be one where at least one of my people was always home to be with me. 
Someone who had the perfect spot for me right by the lounge and the bed and would take me for car rides. Sounds 
simple enough huh</p>
